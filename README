Introduction
------------
This was intended as an example of use mixing Ding and PAMI. However, it might be
useful as a tool to help you monitor/debug your asterisk installation, so I'm 
making it freely available.

Currently, it will monitor:
* All events
* Call activity (CDR like)
* DTMF's pressed
* VarSet's 

Requirements
------------
* PHP 5.3+
* Ding 0.97+ (http://marcelog.github.com/Ding)
* PAMI 1.27+ (http://marcelog.github.com/Ding)
* mysql server
* log4php (optional)

Configuration
-------------
Assuming you are inside the root directory of the source (thus, having ./conf and ./src)

1.- Copy/Rename the file: conf/log4php.properties.example to log4php.properties. Edit it.
2.- Copy/Rename the file: conf/mysql.properties.example to mysql.properties. Edit it. The only
thing you need from mysql, is to have the database created (nothing else, no tables,
AsterTrace will create them on demand).
3.- Copy/Rename the file: conf/php.properties.example to php.properties. Edit it. You can have
your own php settings here.
4.- Copy/Rename the file: conf/astertrace.properties.example to astertrace.properties. Edit it.
5.- Run astertrace, like "php src/mg/AsterTrace/bin/astertrace.php ./conf"
